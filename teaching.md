I will be teaching MATH 1113 Precalculus in Fall 2020. <br/>
In the past, I have taught MATH 1113 Precalculus and MATH 2250 Calculus I for Science and Engineering. <br/>
My classroom is flipped, that is, students watch instructional videos before class and complete a short worksheet. We then spend classtime working on problems in a group setting. <br/>
