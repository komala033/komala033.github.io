I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Georgia with a thesis titled "On Some Problems Concerning Integer Recurring Sequences". <br/>
My advisor was <a href="http://pollack.uga.edu" target="_blank">Paul Pollack.</a> <br/>
Before coming to Georgia I was an undergraduate at BITS Pilani.
I spent my last semester at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru studying Spectral Spaces and Abelian Categories.
