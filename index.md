I am a fourth year graduate student at the University of Georgia. <br/>
My advisor is <a href="http://pollack.uga.edu" target="_blank">Paul Pollack.</a> <br/>
Before coming to Georgia I was an undergraduate at BITS Pilani.
I spent my last semester at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, working under Professor Abhishek Banerjee.
I studied Spectral Spaces and Abelian Categories.
