I am currently working as a Data Scientist at General Aeronautics Pvt Ltd, India. My main responsibilities include drone path planning, and using image processing and deep learning techniques for precision agriculture.<br/>
I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Georgia with a thesis titled "On Some Problems Concerning Integer Recurring Sequences". <br/>
My advisor was <a href="http://pollack.uga.edu" target="_blank">Paul Pollack.</a> <br/>
Before coming to Georgia I was an undergraduate at BITS Pilani.
I spent my last semester at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru studying Spectral Spaces and Abelian Categories.
