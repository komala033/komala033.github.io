I am interested in Analytic Number Theory. Particularly, my thesis focused on the arithmetic of certain recurring sequences like the ```math 
a^n-1 
``` sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, and more general Lucas sequence. The first section of my theis is inspired by Artin's primitive root conjecture and proved that if ```math 
a,b 
``` are multiplicatively independent, then for almost all prime numbers ```math
p 
```, one of ```math
a,b,ab, a^2b, ab^2 
``` has order exceeding ```math 
p^{\frac{8}{15}+ \epsilon(p)} 
```. It also proved that for infinitely many primes ```math
p
```, the order of the Fibonacci Sequence is as large as possible.
In the second section I prove the existence and continuity of the distribution functions of the density of normal and primitive elements in a finite field and the reciprocal sum of divisors of Lucas sequences.  <br/>
